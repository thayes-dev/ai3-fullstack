"""
golden_set.py -- The curated test set for AI-3 Session 1.2 evaluation.

This set was validated against the Northbrook corpus during the Session 1.1
enrichment correctness fix (see decisions/012-enrichment-correctness-fix.md).
It is the seed the class starts with. Students will grow it in Lab 2 by
adding adversarial queries, feedback-derived cases, and out-of-scope checks.

Structure of each entry:
    id               -- Short stable identifier, snake_case
    question         -- The query string (verbatim from student-facing materials)
    expected_answer  -- Ground-truth canonical answer, corpus-grounded, 1-2 sentences
    expected_source  -- List of source filenames that should be retrieved
                        (multi-doc queries may list several)
    category         -- policy_lookup | multi_doc | compound | procedural | out_of_scope
    difficulty       -- easy | medium | hard
    history          -- list[dict] of prior {role, content} messages.
                        Empty [] for single-turn cases. For multi-turn cases,
                        the followup `question` should be UNANSWERABLE without
                        this prior history — that is what makes contextualize_query
                        a measurable lever.

The `expected_answer` strings are short and declarative — they mirror how the
source documents write the information. An LLM judge compares the generated
answer against these strings (see pipeline/eval/evaluators.py).

To explore: print `len(GOLDEN_SET)`, inspect `[q["category"] for q in GOLDEN_SET]`,
or filter by difficulty: `[q for q in GOLDEN_SET if q["difficulty"] == "easy"]`.
