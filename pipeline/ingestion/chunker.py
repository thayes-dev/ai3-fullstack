chunker.py -- Text chunking with metadata for vector ingestion.

This module provides two chunking strategies:
  - chunk_document: paragraph-aware chunking (merges small paragraphs, respects boundaries)
  - chunk_fixed: simple fixed-size chunking (every N tokens with overlap)

The paragraph-aware strategy is the default for the ingestion pipeline.
The fixed-size strategy exists for comparison in notebooks.

All sizing is token-based using the cl100k_base tokenizer (tiktoken).

Usage:
    from pipeline.ingestion.chunker import chunk_document, chunk_fixed, Chunk, count_tokens

    chunks = chunk_document(text, source="memo_001.txt", doc_type="memo")
    chunks_fixed = chunk_fixed(text, source="memo_001.txt")
