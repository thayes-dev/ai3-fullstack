hyde.py -- Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)

HyDE transforms user queries by generating a *hypothetical* answer first,
then embedding that answer for retrieval instead of the raw question.

Why it works:
    Questions and answers live in different embedding neighborhoods.
    "What are Northbrook's consulting fees?" lands in question-space, but
    the actual fee schedule chunk lives in answer-space.  A naive embed of
    the question may never get close enough to surface the right chunk.

    HyDE bridges this "embedding gap" by asking the LLM to imagine what a
    correct answer might look like.  The hypothetical answer -- even though
    it may contain hallucinated details -- occupies the same embedding
    neighborhood as the real answer chunks.  We embed the hypothesis and
    search with it, pulling back the genuine documents that live nearby.

Session 1.1: We build these functions together in class.
