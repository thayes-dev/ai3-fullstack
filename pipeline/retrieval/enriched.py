enriched.py -- Question Enrichment at Ingestion Time

At ingestion time, generate questions each chunk answers.
Embed EACH question as its own row in the vector store, with the
original chunk text as the 'documents' field.

This closes the embedding gap from the other direction: queries match
question embeddings directly (pure question-space), and we return the
chunk that the matched question points to.  While HyDE moves the
*query* into answer-space, enrichment moves the *documents* into
question-space at ingest time.  Both strategies address the same
fundamental problem -- questions and answers occupy different
neighborhoods in embedding space.

Session 1.1: We build these functions together in class.

Re-seeding the enriched collection (~3-5 min for the full corpus,
~$0.50 in API costs):
