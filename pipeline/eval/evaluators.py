"""
evaluators.py -- Pass/fail functions that grade a task's output.

Phoenix calls each evaluator once per experiment row with parameters bound
BY NAME from the dataset and task output:

    input     -> the dataset's inputs[i] dict       (e.g., {"question": "..."})
    output    -> whatever the task returned         (e.g., {"chunks": [...], "answer": "..."})
    expected  -> the dataset's outputs[i] dict      (e.g., {"expected_answer": "...", ...})
    metadata  -> the dataset's metadata[i] dict     (optional; ids, categories, etc.)

You only declare the parameters you actually use. Phoenix figures out the rest.

Session 1.2: We build two evaluators together in class.

  Pattern A (deterministic, ~10 lines):
      retrieval_hit(output, expected) -> bool
      "Did retrieval pull the expected source document?"

  Pattern B (LLM-as-judge, ~25 lines):
      answer_addresses_question(input, output, expected) -> dict
      "Does the generated answer align with the expected answer?"
      Uses STRUCTURED OUTPUT (Pydantic + tool_use) — callback to AI-2 Session 1.2.

Students: read the docstrings, then fill in the function bodies during class.

       input_blocked=True. If it got through, the defense failed.
